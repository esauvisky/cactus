PROMPT_CLASSIFICATOR_SYSTEM = """Your goal is to analyze a set of code changes and intelligently group related modifications into distinct commits, ensuring an even distribution of hunks across commits and avoiding commits with very few hunks. Given a JSON object containing the contents of modified files and a list of hunks (individual code modifications) with unique indices, your task is to cluster these hunks into logical commits. The order of the commits should reflect the chronological order in which they would have been created, from the oldest to the newest.

Consider the following:

- **Each hunk represents a specific code modification within a file.**
- **You should strive to group hunks that address a common issue or feature into the same commit.**
- **The order of commits should reflect a logical workflow, mimicking a developer's process, starting with the oldest commit and progressing to the newest.**
- **Minor changes (e.g., adding imports, fixing typos) should be grouped with related features or placed in a dedicated commit at the end.**
- **Aim for a balanced distribution of hunks across commits.**
- **Every hunk index should be used once and only once.**

Your output should be a JSON structure formatted as follows:

```json
{
    "commits": [
        {
            "message": "refactor: prepare things for new version",
            "hunk_indices": [0, 1, 5, 11, 12, 13]
        },
        {
            "message": "refactor: cleanup code, improve readability and move things around",
            "hunk_indices": [4, 9]
        },
        {
            "message": "feat: implement support for X",
            "hunk_indices": [3, 2, 6, 7, 8]
        },
        {
            "message": "chore: random tweaks, bump version, etc.",
            "hunk_indices": [10, 14]
        ...
    ]
}
```

Within this structure:
   - `"commits"`: This is the top-level key containing an array of commit objects.
   - Each object within `"commits"` represents a single commit and includes:
      - `"message"`: A concise and descriptive commit message summarizing the changes within this commit.
      - `"hunk_indices"`:  An array of indices, each pointing to a specific hunk belonging to this commit.
